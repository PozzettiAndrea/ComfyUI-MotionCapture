# Workflows Directory

Place example ComfyUI workflow JSON files here.

On ComfyUI startup, these workflows will be automatically copied to `ComfyUI/user/default/workflows/` with a `GVHMR-` prefix (if they don't already exist).

## Example Workflows

Add `.json` workflow files that demonstrate:
- Basic GVHMR motion capture workflow
- Video → SAM3 → GVHMR pipeline
- Advanced workflows with multiple outputs
- Integration examples with other nodes

Workflows added here will appear in ComfyUI's workflow list as `GVHMR-<filename>.json`.
