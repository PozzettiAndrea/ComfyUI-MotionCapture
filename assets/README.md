# Assets Directory

Place example videos, images, or other assets here.

On ComfyUI startup, these files will be automatically copied to `ComfyUI/input/` (if they don't already exist).

## Example Assets

You can add:
- Example video files for testing motion capture
- Sample images with people for testing
- Reference materials

Files added here will be available in ComfyUI's Load Image/Load Video nodes.
